# Motion

Animation is one of the fastest ways to make a UI feel expensive or cheap. The rule that separates the two: **motion should clarify, not decorate.** Every animation should answer "what changed", "where did this come from", or "did the interface hear me?" If movement cannot answer one of those, delete it.

## Motion decision gate

Run this gate before writing animation code.

| Question | Ship motion when | Delete or reduce when |
|---|---|---|
| How often will users see it? | Occasional, rare, first-run, or explanatory moments | Keyboard actions, command palettes, core navigation, dense lists, and anything seen dozens of times per day |
| What purpose does it serve? | Feedback, spatial consistency, state indication, explanation, or preventing a jarring change | The only answer is "it looks cool" |
| Can it stay within budget? | UI motion stays under 300ms, with smaller pieces under 200ms | The effect needs slow showmanship to work |
| Does it help the task? | It makes state, hierarchy, or progress clearer | It moves data the user is trying to read or act on |

High-frequency UI should feel instant. Rare moments can carry more personality. A daily-use dashboard often needs less motion than a launch page.

## GSAP is the default motion engine

A static-looking site is one of the fastest ways a generated UI reads as a template rather than a real product. **GSAP + ScrollTrigger is the default for Tastemaker marketing pages** because it handles scroll-driven reveals, staggered entrances, and timeline-sequenced hero moments cleanly. For app shells, use GSAP without ScrollTrigger, CSS transitions, or a motion library that matches the stack.

Install it per `references/tech-stack-guides.md`, then wire up `assets/gsap-starter.js`:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/gsap.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
<script src="gsap-starter.js"></script>
<script>
  TastemakerMotion.init({
    duration: 0.22,
    distance: 16,
    ease: "power3.out",
    staggerStep: 0.06,
  });
</script>
```

```html
<div data-reveal>Fades/rises in on scroll</div>
<div data-reveal data-reveal-group>
  <div>Child 1</div>
  <div>Child 2</div>
</div>
```

`gsap-starter.js` uses `gsap.matchMedia()` for reduced motion. The fallback pair, `assets/reveal.css` and `assets/reveal.js`, uses the same `data-reveal` markup and exists for constrained contexts that cannot load GSAP.

## Exact curves and durations

Use these as CSS tokens unless the project lock has stricter values:

```css
:root {
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
  --ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
  --duration-press: 120ms;
  --duration-popover: 180ms;
  --duration-panel: 240ms;
}
```

| Element | Duration | Easing |
|---|---:|---|
| Button press | 100-160ms | `var(--ease-out)` |
| Tooltip or small popover | 125-200ms | `var(--ease-out)` |
| Dropdown or select | 150-250ms | `var(--ease-out)` |
| Modal or drawer | 200-500ms | `var(--ease-drawer)` for sheets, `var(--ease-out)` for centered modals |
| On-screen movement or morph | 180-300ms | `var(--ease-in-out)` |
| Scroll storytelling | as needed | `power3.out` or a scrubbed timeline |

Avoid `ease-in` for UI. It starts slow at the exact moment the user expects a response.

## anime.js — a scoped alternative, not a GSAP replacement

GSAP stays the default for every project (above). anime.js was evaluated as a second option — a real side-by-side test (bundle weight measured directly, the reveal/reduced-motion pattern hand-built and run in a browser, not assumed from docs) found it's not a better general-purpose default, but it does have two genuine, narrow use cases where it's the better tool:

1. **A page that needs both scroll-reveals and SVG motion-path/shape-morphing for constructed logo marks or hand-built illustrations** (`references/logo-sourcing.md`). Measured directly via each library's current CDN "latest" tag, the same one this repo's own install snippets point at: anime.js v4's full bundle — animation engine, ScrollObserver, Draggable, spring physics, *and* the SVG toolset (`svg.morphTo`, `svg.createMotionPath`, `svg.createDrawable`), everything included — is **~118KB minified / ~41KB gzipped**. Matching that same feature set in GSAP means core + ScrollTrigger + Draggable + MorphSVGPlugin + DrawSVGPlugin, which comes to **~179KB minified / ~69KB gzipped** — genuinely, verifiably larger (~34% more over the wire, gzipped). For a page whose brief calls for both scroll storytelling *and* a morphing/drawing SVG mark, anime.js's single bundle is the lighter way to get both.
2. **SVG motion-path/shape-morphing alone, on a page that otherwise doesn't need scroll-triggered motion.** Same tools, same reasoning as above, just without the reveal engine attached — reach for anime.js's SVG toolset directly rather than adding two more GSAP plugin files for one moment on the page.

**Bundle size alone does not justify anime.js for simple reveals with no SVG need — this was checked and doesn't hold up.** The obvious-sounding case ("anime.js is lighter, use it for basic scroll-reveals") was tested and rejected: loaded via a plain `<script>` CDN tag (this project's default, no-build-step pattern), anime.js's bundle is **~118KB min / ~41KB gzip** against GSAP core + ScrollTrigger's **~117KB min / ~46KB gzip** — a wash on minified size, and only a modest ~11% gzip difference, because a plain script tag can't tree-shake away the Draggable/spring/SVG code a reveal-only page never uses. (A project actually using a bundler with anime.js's ESM submodule exports could tree-shake further, but that's a different build setup than the CDN-tag default this skill assumes — not a reason to switch the default.) Reach for anime.js on bundle-size grounds *only* when the SVG toolset is also genuinely needed, per the two cases above.

**Everything else stays on GSAP.** The reasoning that ruled out a full swap: this project has a real, working, tested investment in GSAP already (`assets/gsap-starter.js`, the `data-reveal` convention, the App-shell/marketing motion-track split, `gsap.matchMedia()` as the reduced-motion backbone) — porting all of that gets no payoff for the standard case, since what actually makes a page feel premium is choreography and restraint, not which engine executes the tween. anime.js's `createScope({ mediaQueries })` is a real, working equivalent to `gsap.matchMedia()` — verified, not assumed — so reduced-motion support isn't a blocker where anime.js *is* used. Spring-based draggable micro-interactions (a real gap in current App-shell motion guidance) were identified as a plausible third use case but not built into a starter yet — flagged as open follow-up work, not silently dropped.

If a project's brief calls for anime.js under either scoped case, use `assets/anime-starter.js` — it mirrors `gsap-starter.js`'s `[data-reveal]`/`[data-reveal-group]` convention so a project can use either engine without touching markup. Two real porting gotchas found by hands-on testing, not by reading docs:

- **Scroll-threshold syntax does not carry over from GSAP.** GSAP's `"top 85%"` string means nothing to anime.js's `ScrollObserver` — it silently matches nothing and the element never reveals. anime.js's own syntax (position keywords `top`/`bottom`/`start`/`end`, on both target and container) is different enough that copying a GSAP trigger string is a real, silent failure mode. Use the library's own defaults unless a specific threshold is actually needed.
- **No automatic on-creation visibility check.** GSAP's `ScrollTrigger` checks whether a target is already in view at creation and fires immediately if so. anime.js's `ScrollObserver` only fires `onEnter` on an actual scroll-crossing transition — left alone, anything already above the fold (a hero's own `[data-reveal]` group) sits invisible until the user's first scroll. `anime-starter.js` fixes this by calling each observer's own `handleScroll()` once right after wiring it; any bespoke anime.js scroll animation needs the same explicit initial check.

## Motion (motion.dev) — the React-component engine, and the one that also works build-free

GSAP stays the default for this skill's own page-level motion (above). Motion — formerly Framer Motion — is the right engine in two specific situations, and `references/library-selection.md` already names the first:

1. **React projects where components need springs, layout animation, exit animation (`AnimatePresence`), or gesture-driven values.** GSAP can do most of this, but Motion's component model fits React's lifecycle without the manual cleanup that ScrollTrigger instances demand in `useEffect`.
2. **A component pulled from a registry that already ships with Motion** (`references/component-sourcing.md`). Don't rip out its animation layer to redo it in GSAP — retune its durations/easings to the lock's Motion values instead, and note that the project now carries Motion.

Install: `npm install motion`. It also loads with **no build step**, which matters for this skill's plain-HTML default:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { animate, scroll, inView, stagger } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/motion@12/+esm"
</script>
```

Pin the major version rather than `@latest` in anything shipped — Motion's own docs say this explicitly.

Verified API shapes:

```js
animate(el, { scale: [0.4, 1] }, { ease: "circInOut", duration: 1.2 })
animate(el, { rotate: 90 }, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300 })
animate("li", { y: 0, opacity: 1 }, { delay: stagger(0.1) })
inView("section", () => animate("section", { opacity: [0, 1] }))

// scroll-linked: build the animation, then hand it to scroll()
const a = animate("div", { transform: ["none", "rotate(90deg)"] }, { ease: "linear" })
scroll(a, { target: document.getElementById("item"), offset: ["start end", "end start"] })
```

**One engine per project.** Never load GSAP and Motion together to get one effect from each — the only acceptable reason for both is a pulled component that brought its own, and that should be stated rather than left for the next person to discover. Motion's docs don't document a `prefers-reduced-motion` helper for `scroll()`, so gate it yourself with `matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)")` and render the end state directly, the same contract `gsap.matchMedia()` gives on the default track.

## Scroll storytelling — for landing/marketing pages that should unfold as you scroll

`gsap-starter.js` covers the baseline (things fade/rise in on scroll). A *storytelling* page goes further: it uses scroll position as a timeline, so scrolling feels like advancing through a narrative rather than paging past static blocks. This is what makes a landing page feel crafted rather than assembled. Build these directly with ScrollTrigger (they're page-specific, so they live in the project, not in the shared starter):

- **Scrubbed reveals** (`scrub: true`) tie an animation's progress to scroll position, so an element draws/moves *as* the user scrolls rather than firing once. Great for a hero visual that assembles, a number that counts up, a path that draws.
- **Pinned sections** (`pin: true`) hold a section in place while its content advances through steps — the classic "one sticky panel, content changes as you scroll" storytelling beat. Use sparingly (one, maybe two per page); pinning everything is disorienting.
- **Sequenced hero timeline**: a `gsap.timeline()` on load with at most four coherent beats — context/navigation → headline → subhead + actions → the single proof visual. Animate the visual as one composition rather than staggering all its internal labels. This preserves the hierarchy established in `references/hero-guidelines.md` instead of making every element ask for attention.
- **Parallax depth**: move background/foreground layers at slightly different scroll rates (small `y` offsets tied to scroll) for a sense of depth — subtle is the whole game; large offsets read as a gimmick.

Keep it coherent with the locked motion feel (`.tastemaker/style-lock.md`): a "premium/confident" project storytells with restraint (slow, smooth, minimal), a "playful" one can be more energetic. And every one of these must degrade under `prefers-reduced-motion` — wrap them in the same `gsap.matchMedia()` pattern `gsap-starter.js` uses, showing the end state without the scroll-driven motion.

## Cursor / pointer-driven motion — for a hero that should feel alive, not just animate on load

Scroll-triggered reveals fire once and stop; a page that only moves on scroll and hover can still feel static while the visitor is just sitting there reading the hero. Cursor-driven motion — an element that subtly tracks or reacts to the mouse in real time — is the difference between a hero that "has an animation" and one that feels alive, and it's the technique behind a lot of premium/playful marketing sites (a mascot's eyes or whole body drifting toward the cursor, a hero visual tilting with pointer position, a card set showing parallax depth as the mouse moves). Reach for this on a hero when the mood is playful/consumer or premium/confident and the brief wants noticeably more polish than the baseline — it's a deliberate upgrade, not a default every project needs.

**The core technique — lerped follow, not 1:1 tracking.** Never set an element's position directly to the raw mouse coordinate; that reads as jittery and mechanical. Track a *target* value on `mousemove`, then ease a *current* value toward it every frame (linear interpolation, `current += (target - current) * factor`, factor around 0.06-0.12 — lower factors feel heavier/laggier, higher feels snappier) inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop, and apply `current` as a `transform: translate()`. This is what makes the motion feel like it has weight and follows smoothly instead of snapping to the cursor.

```js
let targetX = 0, targetY = 0, curX = 0, curY = 0;
const strength = 18; // max px of travel — keep small, this is a drift, not a drag
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  const nx = e.clientX / window.innerWidth - 0.5;
  const ny = e.clientY / window.innerHeight - 0.5;
  targetX = nx * strength;
  targetY = ny * strength;
});
gsap.ticker.add(() => {
  curX += (targetX - curX) * 0.08;
  curY += (targetY - curY) * 0.08;
  gsap.set(el, { x: curX, y: curY });
});
```

(`gsap.ticker` is a convenient shared rAF loop when GSAP is already loaded — plain `requestAnimationFrame` works identically if it isn't.)

**Depth via differential strength, not a single moving layer.** The premium version of this effect moves multiple layers at different `strength` values off the same pointer position — a background shader/glow at a small strength (subtle drift), a mid-layer character or card set at a medium strength, a foreground label or badge at the highest strength — so the parallax between layers reads as real depth, not one element sliding around alone. Keep the *foreground* strength small regardless (10-25px range) — this is ambient depth, not a drag interaction; anything larger starts to feel like the element is trying to escape the cursor.

**Character/mascot-specific: eyes or gaze lead the drift, before the whole body does.** If the hero has a character (see `references/asset-curation.md`'s character/mascot sourcing), the cheapest, highest-payoff version of "it reacts to you" is just the eyes (or a single focal detail) tracking the cursor at a higher strength than the character's body — a small pupil/eye element that lerps toward the pointer within a tight radius reads as *alive* even if nothing else on the page moves. Layer the body-level drift (small, per the depth rule above) on top only if the brief wants more.

**Respect the trigger surface.** Bind `mousemove` to the hero section (or `window`, scoped to only apply the transform while the pointer is over the hero) — not the whole document — so the effect doesn't fight with unrelated page motion once the visitor scrolls past. Reset to the rest position (`curX`/`curY` easing back to 0) on `mouseleave` rather than freezing at the last position.

**Accessibility and device gating, same rules as everywhere else in this file:**
- Gate behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` — touch devices have no persistent cursor, so this is a no-op there by construction; don't attach the listeners at all rather than have dead code.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — skip the rAF loop entirely and leave the element at its rest position. This is genuinely decorative motion, unlike the drag-follow in the App shell section below, so the reduced-motion branch is mandatory here.
- Keep the strength values small enough that they never obscure or relocate text/CTAs — this is ambient personality, not a layout mechanism, and it must never make a click target move out from under a pointer mid-click.

## App shell motion — for internal tools, dashboards, and anything that isn't a scroll narrative

The scroll-storytelling track above is the right model for a page the user scrolls through once, top to bottom. It is close to meaningless for a sidebar-plus-topbar internal tool: most of the screen loads once and stays in place while the user works, there is no scroll narrative to tell, and a scrubbed hero reveal or a pinned section has nothing to attach to. Motion is still not optional here (per this file's own "motion should clarify, not decorate" rule), it just answers different questions: what changed, what's about to happen, is this still loading.

- **Panel/tab switches**: a short cross-fade or directional slide (8-12px translate + opacity) tied to the navigation direction, so moving forward and back through the app reads consistently rather than a generic fade every time. Ties to the "page/state transitions" rule below.
- **List/table entrances**: when a view first populates, stagger rows/cards in with the same `data-reveal`/`data-reveal-group` convention `gsap-starter.js` already provides, just triggered on data-load instead of on scroll-into-view, rather than letting the whole table snap into existence at once.
- **State changes**: a KPI ticking to a new value, a status badge changing, a row being added or removed, a field validating. Animate the specific thing that changed, not the surrounding layout. This is what "what changed" from the top of this file actually looks like in an app shell.
- **Loading states, promoted to first-class**: skeleton screens that mirror the real layout, not a generic spinner. This used to be a single bullet under the marketing-oriented guidance below; it earns the promotion because it is the motion moment most internal tools actually need right, and it is a genuinely different problem from a scroll reveal.
- **Draggable, spring-based micro-interactions**: a draggable panel with snap points, a reorderable list row, a snap-to-position control — physics-based release motion reads as more tactile than an eased tween for anything the user directly manipulates with a pointer. See the dedicated section below for which engine and how.

None of this needs ScrollTrigger. `gsap.to()`/`gsap.from()` with the same duration and easing recorded in `.tastemaker/style-lock.md`'s Motion section is enough, wired reduced-motion-aware the same way as everything else in this file.

### Draggable interactions: use whichever engine the project is already on

Evaluated GSAP's `Draggable` + `InertiaPlugin` against anime.js's `createDraggable` + `createSpring` for this specific case — a draggable panel with snap points — the same rigor the original GSAP-vs-anime.js evaluation used (`references/animation-guidelines.md`'s anime.js section above). The finding here is the same shape as that one, for the same underlying reason: **bundle size is a wash between the two options on their own** (GSAP core + `Draggable` + `InertiaPlugin` measures ~116KB minified / ~44KB gzipped; anime.js's full bundle, which already includes its draggable and spring tools, measures ~118KB minified / ~41KB gzipped) — so it is never worth loading a *second* motion engine just to get draggable support. Extend whichever engine the project is already using:

- **GSAP-track projects (the default)**: `Draggable.create(target, { type: "x" | "y" | "x,y", bounds: containerSelector, inertia: true, snap: [...points], onDragEnd })`. `InertiaPlugin` is what makes the release feel like it has real momentum instead of stopping dead where the pointer let go — it's free (see the GSAP-is-the-default section above), so there's no reason to skip it once `Draggable` is in use.
- **anime.js-track projects** (per this file's anime.js section — a page already using anime.js for SVG motion-path/shape-morphing): `anime.createDraggable(target, { x: true, snap: [...points], releaseMass, releaseStiffness, releaseDamping, onSnap })`. `releaseMass`/`releaseStiffness`/`releaseDamping` are anime.js's spring-physics equivalent of `InertiaPlugin` — tune stiffness/damping together (higher damping relative to stiffness settles faster with less overshoot) rather than reaching for `InertiaPlugin`'s more velocity-based feel; they're different physical models, not drop-in equivalents of each other.

**The drag-follow itself is never gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`** — it's direct manipulation tracking the user's own pointer 1:1, not decorative or autoplaying motion, so reduced-motion doesn't apply to it any more than it applies to scrolling itself. What *does* need a reduced-motion branch is the **release/snap settle** — the bouncy, physics-driven motion after the user lets go. Branch it the same way every other animation in this file does (`gsap.matchMedia()` / anime.js's `createScope({ mediaQueries })`): a lower-damping, more visibly springy settle by default, and a critically-damped or near-instant snap (no overshoot) under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — overshoot on release is exactly the kind of motion that reads as uncomfortable for vestibular sensitivity, even though the drag itself is user-initiated.

**Which track applies is a per-screen decision, not a per-project one.** A marketing/landing page uses scroll storytelling; a dashboard, settings screen, or any persistent app shell uses this track instead. A single project can need both (a public landing page plus an authenticated app behind it), in which case each screen gets the track that actually fits it rather than one default applied everywhere. See `SKILL.md` Step 4 for where this branch happens in the build.

## What to animate, and how much

- **Entrances** (page load, scroll-into-view): a small, consistent fade + upward translate (8-16px) is almost always right. Bouncy easing, large distances, or rotation on entrance reads as playful/consumer — only use it if the locked mood (`.tastemaker/style-lock.md`) actually calls for playful. A "premium/confident" project should use a quick, restrained fade (150-250ms, ease-out), not a bounce.
- **Hover/focus states**: fast (100-150ms), subtle (a slight scale, a border/background shift, a shadow lift) — the point is to confirm interactivity, not to perform. Anything longer than ~200ms on hover starts to feel laggy rather than smooth.
- **Loading states**: skeleton screens that mirror the actual layout beat a generic spinner — they set an expectation of what's coming, which is what makes a wait feel shorter. See the App shell motion section above for this promoted to a first-class pattern, not an afterthought.
- **Page/state transitions**: keep direction consistent (things that mean "forward" always animate the same way) — inconsistent transition direction is disorienting even when each individual transition looks fine in isolation.

## Performance rule, non-negotiable regardless of style

Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Anything that animates `width`, `height`, `top`/`left`, or box-shadow spread triggers layout recalculation on every frame and will visibly stutter on anything but a high-end device — this is true no matter how good the animation curve is conceptually.

## Physicality rules

- Pressable elements respond on pointer down. Default: `transform: scale(0.97)` and `transition: transform 120ms var(--ease-out)`.
- Do not animate from `scale(0)`. Start from `scale(0.95)` plus `opacity: 0`.
- Trigger-anchored popovers, menus, and tooltips scale from their trigger. Use `transform-origin: var(--transform-origin)` when the primitive exposes it.
- Modals stay centered. `transform-origin: center` is correct for a modal.
- Enter and exit along the same path. A toast that enters from the top exits to the top.
- Use percentages for off-screen travel when size varies. `translateY(100%)` means the element's own height.
- Add a subtle `filter: blur(2px)` only when a crossfade visibly double-exposes two states. Keep blur under `20px`.

## Gesture and spring rules

Use springs for drag, swipe, interruptible layout changes, and any object the user can grab mid-motion. Start with a critically damped feel: no bounce for standard UI, slight bounce only when a gesture carries momentum.

Recommended Motion spring defaults:

```js
// Standard UI, no overshoot
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.4, bounce: 0 }

// Momentum-driven gesture release
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.4, bounce: 0.2 }
```

Gesture details:

- Respond on pointer down, commit on pointer up.
- Use Pointer Events and `setPointerCapture`.
- Respect where the user grabbed the object. Do not snap the object center to the pointer.
- Track release velocity and hand it to the spring.
- Use soft resistance at boundaries instead of hard stops.

## Performance rule

Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Anything that animates `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `top`, `left`, or box-shadow spread risks layout and paint work every frame.

Also avoid `transition: all`. Name the properties. If a React app uses Motion for animations under load, prefer a full `transform` string over separate `x`, `y`, or `scale` shorthands when frame rate matters.

## Accessibility

Every animation must respect reduced motion. Reduced motion means gentler feedback, not a dead interface: keep opacity/color changes that aid comprehension and drop slides, springs, parallax, and large movement.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .sheet {
    transition: opacity 200ms ease;
    transform: none !important;
  }
}

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .button:hover {
    transform: translateY(-1px);
  }
}
```

If a design uses translucent surfaces, also handle `prefers-reduced-transparency` and `prefers-contrast: more` by increasing opacity, dropping blur, and adding clearer borders.

## Locking motion per project

Once a project settles on a motion feel, record it in `.tastemaker/style-lock.md`:

- Feel: quick and restrained, soft and bouncy, crisp and operational, or another concrete phrase.
- Curves: exact cubic-bezier or library spring values.
- Durations: press, popover, panel, page/story.
- Distance: reveal and panel travel.
- Frequency rules: where to delete or reduce motion for this project.

Motion inconsistency is as visible as color inconsistency, just harder to name.

## Motion review before delivery

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_motion.py site assets references
```

Then do a human feel pass:

- Slow key animations to 25% speed in DevTools or by temporarily multiplying durations.
- Check origin: popovers grow from triggers, modals from center.
- Spam toggles, tabs, and toasts. Motion should retarget, not restart from zero.
- Toggle reduced motion. Movement drops, but state feedback remains.
- Test mobile hover behavior. Touch should not trigger pointer-only hover motion.
