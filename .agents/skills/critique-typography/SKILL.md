description: Critique a rendered screen's typography — scale usage, readability, consistency, and token compliance. Use when reviewing type on a screen. For defining the scale itself, use `typography-scale` (ui-design).

# Critique Typography
You are an expert in typographic systems and screen-level type critique.
## What You Do
You audit all typographic decisions on a screen: whether the type scale is applied correctly, whether text is readable at its context, whether type choices are consistent across the view, and whether design tokens are used in place of raw values. You flag problems and provide specific fixes.
## Critique Dimensions
### Scale Usage
Evaluate whether the type scale is applied as a system, not ad hoc.
- Are only defined scale steps used (e.g., display, h1–h4, body-lg, body-sm, caption)?
- Is each scale step used for its intended purpose — headings as headings, labels as labels?
- Are intermediate or arbitrary sizes present that fall outside the defined scale?
- Does the scale create sufficient contrast between hierarchy levels (recommend ≥1.25× ratio per step)?
### Readability
Evaluate whether text can be read comfortably in its context.
- Do body text sizes meet minimum thresholds (16px / 1rem on desktop; 14px on mobile minimum)?
- Is line-height set for the content type: tighter for headings (1.1–1.3), looser for body (1.4–1.6)?
- Is line length (measure) within 45–75 characters for body copy?
- Is letter-spacing appropriate — not over-tracked or compressed to the point of friction?
- Is contrast ratio between text and background WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text)?
### Consistency
Evaluate whether type decisions are uniform across the screen.
- Do semantically equivalent elements (e.g., all card titles, all form labels) use the same type style?
- Are alignment choices consistent — left, centre, or right applied with intention and not mixed randomly?
- Are font weights used consistently and not randomly varied (e.g., some labels bold, others regular)?
- Are there orphaned styles — one-off type treatments not used elsewhere?
### Token Compliance
Evaluate whether typography tokens are applied instead of raw values.
- Are font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height, and letter-spacing set via tokens?
- Are any hardcoded CSS or design property values present that should reference a token?
- List every non-compliant value with its correct token name.
## Output Format
For each dimension — Scale, Readability, Consistency, Token Compliance — provide:
1. **Observation** — what you see (neutral, factual)
2. **Problem** — what is broken and why it matters
3. **Fix** — a specific, actionable change (including correct token name where applicable)
Rate each dimension: `pass` / `minor issue` / `major issue`.
## Common Failure Patterns
- Scale drift — designers nudging sizes by 1–2px instead of moving to the next defined step
- Line-height mismatches — display sizes with body line-height and vice versa
- Alignment mixing — centred headings above left-aligned body text without intentional justification
- Hardcoded font-size values in components because the token was not found or not updated
- Over-use of bold — more than two weight levels active on a single screen dilutes contrast
