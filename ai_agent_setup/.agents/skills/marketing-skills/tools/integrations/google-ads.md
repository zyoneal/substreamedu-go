  "query": "SELECT ad_group_criterion.keyword.text, metrics.impressions, metrics.clicks, metrics.average_cpc FROM keyword_view WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS ORDER BY metrics.clicks DESC LIMIT 50"
}
```

### Pause campaign

```bash
POST https://googleads.googleapis.com/v24/customers/{customer_id}/campaigns:mutate

{
  "operations": [{
    "update": {
      "resourceName": "customers/{customer_id}/campaigns/{campaign_id}",
      "status": "PAUSED"
    },
    "updateMask": "status"
  }]
}
```

### Update budget

```bash
POST https://googleads.googleapis.com/v24/customers/{customer_id}/campaignBudgets:mutate

{
  "operations": [{
    "update": {
      "resourceName": "customers/{customer_id}/campaignBudgets/{budget_id}",
      "amountMicros": "50000000"
    },
    "updateMask": "amountMicros"
  }]
}
```

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `metrics.impressions` | Ad impressions |
| `metrics.clicks` | Clicks |
| `metrics.cost_micros` | Cost in micros (divide by 1M) |
| `metrics.conversions` | Conversions |
| `metrics.conversions_value` | Conversion value |
| `metrics.average_cpc` | Average cost per click |
| `metrics.ctr` | Click-through rate |
| `metrics.conversion_rate` | Conversion rate |

## Campaign Types

- `SEARCH` - Search network text ads
- `DISPLAY` - Display network
- `SHOPPING` - Product shopping ads
- `VIDEO` - YouTube video ads
- `PERFORMANCE_MAX` - AI-optimized across channels

## GAQL (Google Ads Query Language)

```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.conversions
FROM campaign
WHERE
  campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
  AND segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
ORDER BY metrics.conversions DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Analysis recipes

Baseline queries for reading an account honestly. See the ads skill's `references/reading-google-ads-data.md` for why each matters.

**Campaign inventory** (separates real campaigns from expired experiment arms and learning bid strategies):

```sql
SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name, campaign.status, campaign.serving_status,
       campaign.primary_status, campaign.primary_status_reasons,
       campaign.experiment_type, campaign.bidding_strategy_type
FROM campaign
WHERE campaign.status != 'REMOVED'
```

**Monthly performance since launch** (only months with activity come back, so the first row is the first month with spend; run before quoting any CPA):

```sql
SELECT segments.month, metrics.impressions, metrics.clicks,
       metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions
FROM campaign
WHERE campaign.id = <ID>
  AND segments.date BETWEEN '<EARLY_DATE>' AND '<TODAY>'
ORDER BY segments.month
```

**Conversions by action** (primary vs secondary):

```sql
SELECT segments.conversion_action_name, segments.conversion_action_category,
       metrics.conversions, metrics.all_conversions
FROM campaign
WHERE campaign.id = <ID>
  AND segments.date BETWEEN '<START>' AND '<END>'
  AND metrics.all_conversions > 0
```

**Search terms, unfiltered** (then reconcile disclosed clicks against campaign clicks for the same window):

```sql
SELECT search_term_view.search_term, ad_group.name, metrics.impressions,
       metrics.clicks, metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions
FROM search_term_view
WHERE campaign.id = <ID>
  AND segments.date BETWEEN '<START>' AND '<END>'
ORDER BY metrics.impressions DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

Raise the limit until disclosed clicks stop growing; a low limit hides the long tail.

**Ads with final URLs** (ad groups often serve several destinations):

```sql
SELECT ad_group.name, ad_group_ad.ad.id, ad_group_ad.status,
       ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls, metrics.clicks, metrics.conversions
FROM ad_group_ad
WHERE campaign.id = <ID>
  AND segments.date BETWEEN '<START>' AND '<END>'
```

**Change history** (who changed what; 30-day maximum):

```sql
SELECT change_event.change_date_time, change_event.change_resource_type,
       change_event.resource_change_operation, change_event.client_type,
       change_event.user_email, change_event.changed_fields
FROM change_event
WHERE change_event.change_date_time >= '<29_DAYS_AGO>'  -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
  AND change_event.change_date_time <= '<TOMORROW>'
ORDER BY change_event.change_date_time DESC
LIMIT 200
```

`LIMIT` is required on `change_event` and capped at 10,000.

### Gotchas

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `campaign.start_date` → `UNRECOGNIZED_FIELD` | Newer API versions use `campaign.start_date_time`; if that also fails, derive the start from the first month the monthly query returns |
| `DURING LAST_90_DAYS` → `INVALID_VALUE_WITH_DURING_OPERATOR` | Only some date literals are valid; use `segments.date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD'` |
| `change_event` → `START_DATE_TOO_OLD` | 30-day limit, strictly enforced; pad the start by a day |
| `change_event` errors with no limit | `LIMIT` is required |
| Cost looks 1,000,000x too big | `cost_micros` ÷ 1,000,000 |
| Keyword or change queries return huge payloads | Write to a file and parse; `keyword_view` returns negatives too (split on `ad_group_criterion.negative`) |

### Manager account access in the CLI

When OAuth credentials access a client through a manager account, set
`GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` to that manager ID. The CLI removes display hyphens
and sends `login-customer-id` on both report and mutation requests. Keep
`GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` set to the target client account. Direct client access
does not require the manager variable. See
[Google Ads REST authorization](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/auth).
